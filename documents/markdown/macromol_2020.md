## **ABSTRACT:** 
Metal-ligand interactions provide a means for modulating the mechanical properties of metallopolymers as well as an avenue toward understanding the connection between crosslink interaction strength and macroscale mechanical properties. In this work, we used nickel carboxylate as the tunable cross-linking interaction in a metallopolymer. Different numbers and types of neutral ligands that coordinate to the metal center are introduced as an easy approach to adjust the strength of the ionic interactions in the nickel carboxylate cross-links, thus allowing macroscale mechanical properties to be tuned. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, with the external forces explicitly included (EFEI) approach, were used to quantify how the number and type of ligands affect the stiffness, strength, and thermodynamic stability of the nickel carboxylate cross-linking interactions. Interpreting the bulk material properties in the context of these DFT results suggests that the stiffness and strength of the cross-linking interactions primarily control the initial stiffness and yield strength of the metallopolymer, while the mechanical behavior at higher strain is controlled by dynamical bond re-formation and interactions with the polymer environment. The physicochemical insight gained from this work can be used in the rational design of metallopolymers with a wide scope of targeted mechanical properties.

## ■ INTRODUCTION

The consolidation of metal cations into a polymer architecture has been demonstrated as an efficient method to modify the mechanical behavior of polymeric materials.<sup>1-4</sup> Organometallic complexes can function as network cross-linkers,<sup>2,5</sup> as part of a linear backbone,<sup>6–8</sup> as grafting points,<sup>9</sup> as the driving force for phase segregation,<sup>10,11</sup> and even as intrachain cross-linkers in organic nanoparticles.<sup>11,12</sup> The metal-ligand interactions that form these complexes can vary from weak, dynamic bonds to strong, covalent-like bonds that are effectively static.' This range of bond strengths makes the use of these complexes a flexible and robust approach for controlling the mechanical properties of polymers.<sup>14</sup> In addition, these complexes can impart desirable characteristics such as self-healing<sup>15-17</sup> and stimuli responsiveness<sup>18-20</sup> that are not usually achievable with covalent bonding alone. Several studies have shown that the stability and mechanical strength of these interactions in metallopolymers can be tuned by using either different metal cations or different binding ligands.<sup>1,2,6,21</sup> However, tuning the mechanical properties of polymers with these methods often requires new synthetic routes and processing methods. As such, a facile method is needed for modulating the metalligand interaction and hence the mechanical properties of polymers.

In addition, an understanding of how the nature of metalligand interactions influence macroscale mechanical behavior will allow for more effective materials design to suit specific applications. Metal complexes fall within a broader class of force-sensitive bonded interactions.<sup>8,13,16,21-28</sup> Extensive computational and theoretical work has been conducted over the past 20 years to quantify the stiffness, strength, and forcedependent kinetics of mechanochemically sensitive bonds.<sup>29-35</sup> In this regard, density functional theory (DFT)based computational approaches such as COGEF (constrained geometry to simulate forces),<sup>29,36</sup> AISMD (*ab initio* steered molecular dynamics),<sup>37</sup> and EFEI<sup>31</sup> (external forces explicitly included) have been invaluable in the design of materials that incorporate these bonds.<sup>38-40</sup>

In this work, we present a simple technique for easily adjusting the strength of ionic cross-linking interactions between Ni<sup>2+</sup> cations and the carboxylate anions on the backbone of an acrylic polymer. In particular, we study how the attachment of neutral ligands to the cross-linking metal center weakens the ionic interaction and alters the macroscale mechanical properties. By combining DFT calculations with bulk experiments, we provide a fundamental understanding of how changes in the number and type of ligands can be used to tune the mechanical properties of the bulk polymer. Theoretical analysis enables us to identify which features of the bulk mechanical behavior can be tuned by modifying the strength and stiffness of the cross-links and which features can be tuned from changing the ligand-environment interactions. These findings have broad implications for the design of polymers with dynamic cross-links and the possibility for secondary interactions to dominate aspects of the mechanical response. In doing so, we provide a facile and rational design procedure that uses ligands to create a versatile class of metallopolymers with highly tunable bulk mechanical properties.

Image /page/1/Figure/4 description: The image shows two chemical reaction schemes, one labeled "Copolymer Synthesis" and the other labeled "Control / Homopolymer Synthesis". In the Copolymer Synthesis scheme, two molecules, one with a hydroxyl group and an acrylate group and the other with two hydroxyl groups and two acrylate groups, react with Ni(OAc)2(H2O)4 to form an intermediate. Acetic acid is removed via vacuum distillation. The intermediate is then exposed to a photoinitiator at 365 nm, resulting in a nickel crosslinked polymer. In the Control / Homopolymer Synthesis scheme, a molecule with a hydroxyl group and an acrylate group reacts with Ni(OAc)2(H2O)4 to form an intermediate. The intermediate is then exposed to a photoinitiator at 365 nm, resulting in a nickel dispersed homopolymer.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

### Nickel Carboxylate Cross-Linked Network Synthesis and Characterization. 
All polymers were synthesized by 365 nm UV-initiated free radical copolymerization of the acrylic formulation in a dog-bone-shaped silicone mold pressed between two laminated glass plates (Figures S1 and S2). For the Ni<sup>2+</sup> cross-linked network (Ni), the acrylic formulation was prepared by dissolving nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate salt (Ni(OAc)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>) in a mixture of 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) and 2-carboxyethyl acrylate (CEA); see the Supporting Information. HEA serves as a hydrophilic neutral monomer, and the CEA reacts with the Ni<sup>2+</sup> cations to generate the ionic cross-linker after removal of the acetic acid under vacuum (Scheme 1). The quantity of Ni(OAc)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub> was chosen to provide a 1:2 ratio of Ni<sup>2+</sup>:CEA. The combination of a fast curing process, a hydrophilic monomer composition that is compatible with the nickel cations, and a synthesized polymer with a glass transition temperature ( $T_g$ ) above ambient temperature ensures homogeneous dispersion of the Ni<sup>2+</sup> throughout the polymer bulk and suppresses potential phase segregation.<sup>41</sup> The linear copolymer (Linear) was synthesized under the same conditions without the addition of the nickel salt. In addition, homopolymers of HEA with and without Ni(OAc)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub> were synthesized as controls (Ni\* and Linear\* in Scheme 1), since they cannot generate nickel carboxylate cross-linkers.

The successful attachment of nickel cations to the carboxylate cross-linkers was determined by the peak shift of the C=O bond stretching vibration in the IR spectrum. The **Linear** and **Linear\*** polymers show only one peak at ~1724 cm<sup>-1</sup> for the C=O stretching vibration of the backbone ester groups and the free carboxylic acid (Figure 1a). For the Ni and Ni\* polymers, an additional peak is present at ~1581 cm<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to the nickel carboxylate bonds<sup>42</sup> in these systems.

Nickel cross-linking in the copolymer results in an increase in the  $T_g$  from 33.9 to 42.5 °C, as measured by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) (Figure S3). In contrast to this relatively small  $T_g$  change, nickel cross-linking has a dramatic effect on the mechanical properties of the copolymer. Figure 1b shows the stress-strain curve of the Ni and Linear copolymers (as well as the Ni\* and Linear\* homopolymers) under uniaxial tensile stress at a strain rate of 0.114s<sup>-1</sup>. Here, we find that the non-cross-linked Linear copolymer presents typical behavior for a lightly cross-linked or entangled elastomer. By introducing nickel cross-linking, we find that Ni is characterized by a 15-fold increase in stiffness (4.11 to 62.6 MPa) and yield stress (0.213 to 3.03 MPa) as well as a substantial reduction in elongation (from 596% to 156%) when compared to the Linear copolymer. This Ni behavior is reminiscent of a thermoplastic elastomer. Furthermore, the Ni\* control homopolymer has only a slightly stiffer response than Linear\*, thereby corroborating our hypothesis that nickel carboxylate cross-linking is responsible for the dramatic changes in the mechanical properties.

### **Effects of Ligand Addition.** 
We next sought to modulate the bulk mechanical properties of **Ni** by altering the stiffness and strength of the nickel carboxylate cross-links. Our hypothesis here was that the introduction of ligands that are higher in the spectrochemical series than water—which originally stabilizes the octahedral coordination structure of the nickel—would bind more strongly to the metal centers and thereby displace some of the bound water molecules into the second coordination sphere. Doing so would increase the electron density on the metal centers and therefore weaken the ionic nickel carboxylate cross-linking interactions. As such, we chose imidazole (Im) as the first ligand to investigate because it is higher in the spectrochemical series<sup>43</sup> than water and is known to coordinate with Ni<sup>2+</sup> cations.<sup>1,5,44</sup>

To investigate how the introduction of imidazole ligands weakens the nickel carboxylate bonds, we utilized density functional theory (DFT) calculations (in conjunction with the external forces explicitly included (EFEI) procedure<sup>31</sup>) to study the structures and energetics associated with stretching the nickel carboxylate cross-links in the presence of an external force. All EFEI calculations were performed on a series of model systems with the molecular formula Ni- $(OAc)_2(H_2O)_{4-n}(Im)_n$ , with decoordinated water ligands kept in the second coordination sphere (for n > 0). The lowest energy configurations for all of these model systems involved a triplet wave function and an octahedral geometry surrounding the Ni center, with monodentate ( $\kappa^1$ ) and axial binding of the two acetate (OAc) ligands. Throughout this work, we will refer to these model systems as **Model**[Ni] (for *n*) <span id="page-3-0"></span><span id="page-3-0"></span>= 0) and **Model**[ $Im_n$ ] (for n = 1, 2, 3, 4). Following geometry optimizations of the initial Model[Ni] and  $Model[Im_2]$ structures in the absence of any external forces (see Figure 2a), equal and opposite tensile forces (F) of increasing magnitude were applied to the methyl carbon atoms on the OAc moieties, which were taken to represent the attachment points to the polymer (see Figure 2b). In the presence of these external forces (which were incrementally increased by  $\Delta F$  = 0.1 nN), these structures were reoptimized for each increment in accordance with the EFEI procedure<sup>31</sup> to obtain the length change in the nickel carboxylate cross-linking site (taken as the distance between the methyl carbon atoms on the OAc groups). These applied forces were increased until one of the nickel-carboxylate bonds ruptured (see Figure 2b). All DFT calculations were performed in Q-chem<sup>45</sup> (v5.1) using the dispersion-inclusive range-separated hybrid wB97X-V<sup>46</sup> functional and the def2-TZVPP<sup>47</sup> basis set (see the Supporting Information for additional computational details).

As depicted in the theoretically determined mechanical response curves in Figure 2c, we find that Model[Ni] has a linear initial response with a stiffness of 4.5 nN/Å (taken as the initial slope) and a rupture force of 2.2 nN. With two imidazole ligands strongly bound to the metal center, the initial stiffness and rupture force of Model [Im<sub>2</sub>] decrease to 3.1 nN/Å and 1.6 nN, respectively. To consider the possible effect that this change in the cross-link stiffness will induce in the bulk polymer, we performed a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to estimate the mechanical response of the backbone segment between cross-links (i.e., which is composed of seven repeat units of HEA monomers on average). This polymer segment was found to have an initial stiffness of 0.4 nN/Å and a maximum tangent stiffness of 2.4 nN/Å (see Figure S4). Given that the cross-link stiffness is within an order of magnitude of the backbone stiffness, the cross-link will not act as an effectively rigid connection until rupture; hence, we expect that changes in the cross-link stiffness will influence the bulk polymer stiffness. The reduction in the cross-link strength should reduce the bulk polymer yield strength and increase ductility since this crosslink rupture force is below that of a carbon–carbon bond along the backbone.

These model systems were also used to quantify the thermodynamics and kinetics associated with rupturing the nickel–carboxylate cross-links. In particular, we computed the free energy differences ( $\Delta G$ ) and barriers ( $\Delta G^{\ddagger}$ ) between the intact and ruptured configurations of the **Model**[**Ni**] and **Model**[**Im**<sub>2</sub>] systems in the absence of external forces (see Table 1). To obtain the ruptured configuration for each model system, we performed an additional geometry optimization of the structure produced during the final step of the EFEI procedure (in which one of the nickel–carboxylate bonds ruptures). With force-free  $\Delta G$  values of +5.06 kcal/mol (**Model**[**Ni**]) and +6.29 kcal/mol (**Model**[**Im**<sub>2</sub>]), our calculations indicate that intact configurations of the nickel– carboxylate cross-links are preferred over ruptured configurations at equilibrium (i.e., cross-link rupturing processes are not spontaneous). Furthermore, we also found that the forcefree barriers ( $\Delta G^{\ddagger}$ ) to rupturing these model cross-links were 18.13 and 15.60 kcal/mol for **Model**[**Ni**] and **Model**[**Im**<sub>2</sub>], respectively. This observed reduction in  $\Delta G^{\ddagger}$  in **Model**[**Im**<sub>2</sub>] is consistent with our hypothesis that the introduction of free imidazole ligands will weaken the effective nickel–carboxylate bond strength. We also note that these  $\Delta G^{\ddagger}$  values are large enough such that cross-link rupturing processes will not occur at room temperature due to thermal fluctuations alone.

| Model[Ni]    | 5.06                  | 18.13                            |

Inspired by these findings, we performed a series of mechanical tests on the nickel carboxylate cross-linked polymer (Ni) in the presence of 2 equiv of neutral imidazole ligands per cation (Ni-2Im). Following the expected trends from the DFT calculations, we observed decreases in the initial modulus (62.56 to 8.36 MPa) and yield stress (3.03 to 0.69 MPa) in going from Ni to Ni-2Im (Figure 2d). Because load is transmitted through the polymer in an indirect manner, it is expected that these bulk property changes are not directly proportional to the cross-link-scale changes in initial stiffness and rupture strength; however, it is a bit surprising that an  $\sim$ 30% decrease in cross-link stiffness leads to an  $\sim$ 87% decrease in the bulk polymer modulus. This suggests that there is a mechanical coupling between the cross-link and the polymer backbone, wherein the backbone becomes effectively more compliant as the cross-link becomes less rigid. This coupling was also suggested by the slight decrease in  $T_{g}$ observed upon addition of free imidazole ligands. We interpret the yield stress as primarily resulting from the sudden rupture of a large percentage of the cross-links and the post-yield hardening as largely resulting from the formation of new crosslinks. Following this interpretation, Ni-2Im requires less stress to break the cross-links and more time to re-form them as compared to Ni. Under cyclic loading (Figure 2e), both materials exhibit extensive viscoplastic deformation. There is also a substantial loss in the overall strength of Ni-2Im, which is visible in the reduced stress of the cyclic stress-strain response as compared to that of monotonic loading (Figure S5). This likely results from an overall loss in intact cross-links and perhaps associated chain relaxation. The Ni cyclic stress response shows a dramatic reduction in yield strength upon each reload but then dramatically hardens to approach its monotonic response as strain is increased past the prior loading level. This difference in behavior of the Ni-2Im and Ni indicates that the cross-links re-form more slowly when imidazole ligands are bound to the metal center.

### Effects of Varying the Number of Ligands. 
We next sought to obtain further control over these mechanical properties by tuning the number of ligands that were bound to the metal center. We again chose imidazole as the ligand and synthesized three additional polymers with 1 equiv (Ni-1Im), 3 equiv (Ni-3Im), and 4 equiv (Ni-4Im) of imidazole ligands per nickel. The existence of nickel carboxylate cross-linking interactions in all of the polymers with added imidazole ligands was confirmed by the presence of a C==O stretching vibrational peak at slightly smaller frequency compared to Ni<sup>42</sup> (~1560 cm<sup>-1</sup> in the IR spectra, Figure S8). In addition, changes in the color of the Ni<sup>2+</sup> containing materials (Figure **S9**) further corroborate the presence of interactions between the imidazole ligands and the metal center. To study the effects of varying the number of imidazole ligands on the stiffness and strength of the nickel carboxylate cross-links, we first needed to investigate how many imidazole ligands were attached to the metal centers in the **Ni-1Im**, **Ni-2Im**, **Ni-3Im**, and **Ni-4Im** cases.

The plot shows how the population of each model changes as the amount of imidazole increases.

The graph illustrates the force required to stretch each model by a certain length.

This plot illustrates how the stress changes over time under certain conditions.

To proceed, we used DFT to compute binding free energies  $(\Delta G_{\text{bind}}[n])$  for the *consecutive* addition of *n* imidazole ligands to the Model[Ni] system (Figure S6; see the Supporting Information for additional details). Quite interestingly, this theoretical analysis showed that binding the first and second imidazole ligands was quite favorable, with  $\Delta G_{\text{bind}}[1]$  and  $\Delta G_{\rm bind}[2]$  values of -4.60 kcal/mol and -8.34 kcal/mol, respectively. As indicated by the relative magnitudes  $|\Delta G_{\text{bind}}[2]| > |\Delta G_{\text{bind}}[1]|$ , binding a second imidazole is cooperative in nature. With  $\Delta G_{\text{bind}}[3]$  and  $\Delta G_{\text{bind}}[4]$  values of -0.80 kcal/mol and +0.53 kcal/mol, we find that it is significantly less favorable to bind a third or fourth imidazole. We attribute these findings to a combination of electronic and steric effects, as the progressive binding of imidazole ligands increases the electron density on the metal and leads to a more crowded complex.

With these  $\Delta G_{\text{bind}}$  values in hand, we computed the equilibrium populations of **Model**[**Ni**] and **Model**[**Im**<sub>n</sub>] (for n = 1, 2, 3, 4) as a function of the added number of imidazole equivalents (see the Supporting Information for additional details). As depicted in Figure 3a, we find that the equilibrium population of **Model**[**Ni**] rapidly decreases as imidazole is added to the system. This is accompanied by a rapid increase in the population of **Model**[**Im**<sub>2</sub>], while the population of **Model**[ $Im_1$ ] remains at a small and constant (essentially steady-state) value, which is consistent with cooperative binding of the second ligand. Following the addition of 3 equiv, we find that the populations of **Model**[ $Im_2$ ], **Model**[ $Im_3$ ], and **Model**[ $Im_4$ ] converge to ~16%, ~60%, and ~24%, respectively, which is consistent with the slightly endergonic binding of the fourth imidazole.

As depicted in the theoretically determined mechanical response curves in Figure 3b (obtained by using the EFEI procedure), we find that the initial stiffness and rupture force decrease from 3.1 nN/Å and 1.6 nN (Model[Im<sub>2</sub>]) to 1.2 nN/ Å and 0.7 nN (Model[Im<sub>3</sub>]) and 0.74 nN/Å and 0.7 nN (Model[Im<sub>4</sub>]). We note in passing that the EFEI curve for Model[Im<sub>1</sub>] was not computed since the population of this species was negligible (Figure 3a). Interestingly, the EFEI curve for  $Model[Im_4]$  is relatively flat over a large length change (0.5-1.5 Å); we attribute this to a sudden extension of the carboxylate moieties, which were folded inward due to non-bonded interactions. At this point, the response transitions to a more direct pulling on the nickel-carboxylate bonds, wherein Model[Im<sub>4</sub>] is now characterized by a stiffness of  $\sim$ 1.2 nN/Å, and ultimately ruptures at 0.7 nN (which are the same values as Model[Im<sub>3</sub>]). All these observations are consistent with our hypothesis that binding imidazole ligands increases the electron density on the metal and thereby weakens the ionic nickel carboxylate cross-links.

Consistent with our earlier findings regarding the free energies ( $\Delta G$ ) and barriers ( $\Delta G^{\ddagger}$ ) between the intact and ruptured configurations of **Model**[**Ni**] and **Model**[**Im**<sub>2</sub>], we also find that intact configurations of **Model**[**Im**<sub>3</sub>] and **Model**[**Im**<sub>4</sub>] (with force-free  $\Delta G$  values of +2.12 and +2.11 kcal/mol, respectively) are also preferred over ruptured configurations at room temperature. With a force-free  $\Delta G^{\ddagger} = 11.57$  kcal/mol for **Model**[Im<sub>3</sub>], we also find that the barrier to cross-link rupturing remains inaccessible at room temperature. We note in passing that the corresponding  $\Delta G^{\ddagger}$  for **Model**[Im<sub>4</sub>] was not computed, as the force-free rupture also involves a multistep mechanism in which the carboxylate groups unfold.

With these theoretical findings in mind, we then performed an additional series of mechanical tests on the Ni-11m, Ni-3Im, and Ni-4Im polymers. As depicted in Figure 3c, we find that simply varying the number of imidazole ligands allowed us to tune the monotonic stress-strain behavior between the Ni and Linear polymers. This tuning was accomplished without significantly altering the  $T_g$  of the materials (Figure S7). Here, we find that the initial modulus and yield stress both decrease as the number of imidazole equivalents increases from zero (Ni) to three (Ni-3Im) (Figure 3d). With the addition of 4 equiv of imidazole (Ni-4Im), these quantities level off but remain slightly above that of the Linear polymer. These findings are consistent with the theoretical population and EFEI analyses (Figure 3a,b), in that (i) the addition of imidazole ligands weakens the mechanical response of the cross-link structure and (ii) after the addition of 3 equiv these effects are still present but begin to level off (i.e., once the equilibrium populations converge). Experimental stress relaxation results (Figure 3e,f) show that although Ni-3Im and Ni-4Im have a similar peak stress to Linear, their relaxation is more substantial as their curves cross over and continue to diverge from the Linear polymer. Although Ni-2Im starts from a much higher stress, this polymer also crosses over Linear during the 20 min experimental time frame. These results support the notion that the nickel carboxylate crosslinks are dynamic in nature, helping to facilitate stress relaxation by breaking and re-forming.

### Effects of Varying the Types of Ligands. 
As an alternative approach to tune the mechanical properties of these polymers, we now investigate the effects of varying the types of ligands attached to the metal center. Here we consider four new nitrogen-based ligands: methylimidazole (MeIm), pyridine (Py), piperidine (Pipe), and dimethylamine (DMA). These ligands were chosen to span options in terms of nitrogen atom hybridization  $(sp^2 \text{ and } sp^3)$ , bulkiness, and potential for  $\pi$ ···X interactions (with X = -H, cation, anion, or  $\pi$ ) and hydrogen bonding with the surrounding polymer environment. In each case, 2 equiv of a given ligand was added to form the Ni-2MeIm, Ni-2Py, Ni-2Pipe, and Ni-2DMA polymers, and the nickel-carboxylate interactions were again verified by the position of the carboxylate C=O vibrational peak in the IR spectra (Figure S10). Binding energy calculations (see the Supporting Information for additional details) again confirm that the addition of 2 equiv of each ligand to the bulk material corresponds to an equilibrium population that is almost entirely composed of two ligands bound to each nickel center (Table S1).

DFT calculations were again employed to quantify the mechanics and thermodynamics of the model cross-link structures depicted in Figure 4. The EFEI results predict that adding any two of these nitrogen-based ligands will decrease the initial stiffness and rupture force with respect to **Model**[Ni] (Figure 5a). The theoretical results also predict that the mechanical properties of the cross-link for this set of ligands are very similar, with the largest observed differences being ~0.25 nN/Å (initial stiffness) and ~0.1 nN (rupture force). With  $\Delta G$  and  $\Delta G^{\ddagger}$  values ranging from +4.68 to +6.51 kcal/mol and 15.36 to 16.66 kcal/mol, we again find that intact configurations of these model systems are preferred over ruptured configurations at room temperature, and the barriers to cross-link rupturing always remain thermally inaccessible (Table 1). The experimentally obtained monotonic stressstrain responses are presented in Figure 5b. In the small-strain regime, the addition of any two ligand equivalents results in a dramatic decrease in both the initial modulus and yield stress when compared to Ni. However, the differences observed in these properties are rather small among the different ligand types (Figure 5c), which is again consistent with the theoretical EFEI predictions on the model cross-links. In the large strain regime, however, the monotonic stress-strain responses tend to be quite distinct. Since everything except the added ligands was held constant during the preparation and testing of these materials, and the EFEI calculations only considered single/ isolated model cross-links (and predicted little to no mechanical differences), we hypothesize that these large-strain differences are primarily governed by ligand-environment interactions rather than the mechanical response of the crosslinks.

Image /page/5/Figure/7 description: The image shows four different molecular models. The models are labeled as Model[Melm], Model[Py₂], Model[Pipe₂], and Model[DMA₂]. Each model is accompanied by its chemical formula: Ni(OAc)₂(Melm)₂(H₂O)₂·2(H₂O), Ni(OAc)₂(Py)₂(H₂O)₂·2(H₂O), Ni(OAc)₂(Pipe)₂(H₂O)₂·2(H₂O), and Ni(OAc)₂(DMA)₂(H₂O)₂·2(H₂O), respectively. Each model consists of a central nickel atom (Ni) coordinated to acetate (OAc), Melm, Py, Pipe, or DMA ligands, and water (H₂O) molecules. The models are depicted using a ball-and-stick representation, with different colors representing different elements.

Theoretically optimized model systems for the nickelcarboxylate cross-linking structure in the presence of two methylimidazole (Model[MeIm<sub>2</sub>]), pyridine (Model[Py<sub>2</sub>]), piperidine (Model[Pipe<sub>2</sub>]), and dimethylamine (Model[DMA<sub>2</sub>]) ligands (with dotted purple lines indicating hydrogen bonds).

In fact, one can categorize the stress-strain curves in Figure 5b into the following two groups: (i) group I polymers (Ni-2Im, Ni-2MeIm, and Ni-2Py), which exhibit lower post-yield hardening and smaller instantaneous moduli (until a rapid increase near fracture), and (ii) group II polymers (Ni-2Pipe and Ni-2DMA), which exhibit higher post-yield hardening and retain near-constant instantaneous moduli until fracture. In this categorization, it is clear that the group I polymers contain aromatic ligands with sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized (metal-bound) nitrogen atoms, while the group II polymers contain nonaromatic ligands with sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized nitrogens. Moreover, differences in color among the materials made from these ligands (Figure S11) show a clear categorization into two distinct groups in accordance with the sp<sup>2</sup> vs sp<sup>3</sup> hybridization of the metal-bound nitrogen atom on each ligand. Because the theoretical EFEI predictions (Figure 5a) show negligible differences in the cross-link mechanical response between ligand types, the hybridization of the (metal-bound) nitrogen does not seem to be directly responsible for the observed differences in the bulk mechanical behavior. However, we can correlate the observed experimental differences in Figure 5b to the distinct nonbonded interactions that can occur between the ligands in each group and the surrounding polymer environment. In other words, the group I polymers contain aromatic ligands which are capable of forming favorable dispersion (or van der Waals) interactions,  $\pi$ ···X interactions (with X = -H, cation, anion, or  $\pi$ ), and hydrogen bonds (in the case of **Ni-2Im** only) with the environment, while the nonaromatic ligands in the group II polymers can only form dispersion interactions with the polymer environment. Unlike dispersion interactions (which are radial and nondirectional), the  $\pi \cdots X$  and hydrogen bond interactions present in the group I polymers are directional and can constrain the diffusion of broken cross-links throughout the polymer environment. As a result, the rate of dynamic cross-link re-formation in the group I polymers could be substantially lower than that in the group II polymers. This conjecture is consistent with the monotonic stress-strain curves in Figure 5b, in which the group I polymers (following the rupture of many cross-links at yield) are characterized by a lower post-yield hardening (due to the relatively slower crosslink re-formation). In contrast, the more rapid cross-link reformation in the group II polymers manifests as higher postyield hardening and larger instantaneous moduli until fracture.

This explanation for the large-strain monotonic features is also consistent with the observed bulk mechanical responses to cyclic loading. Here, we find that the group I polymers recover much less than the group II polymers (Figure 5d,e), as the residual strain (i.e., at zero stress) after each cycle is much smaller for group II than group I. We further investigated this point by computing the percentage of recovered mechanical energy per cycle based on the cyclic stress-strain responses (Figure 5f). From these results, we find that the group II polymers are characterized by a nearly constant energy recovery, which is consistent with breaking and re-forming a similar number of cross-links during each cycle. On the other hand, we find that the group I polymers are characterized by an initially low recovery percentage that increases rapidly and begins to level off after  $\sim$ 5 cycles. This is also consistent with a slower rate of cross-link re-formation among the group I polymers, in which the energy recovered during each cycle continues to change until most cross-links are broken. These group I polymers essentially transition from a viscoplastic response to an elastomeric one as the cross-links break, with polymer chains that are effectively linear dominating the response.

Ligand-environment interactions can also be used to rationalize the observed differences within each polymer group. For instance, the mechanical response of Ni-2Im is noticeably different from Ni-2MeIm and Ni-2Py. More specifically, Ni-2Im has a higher yield stress than Ni-2MeIm and Ni-2Py, and maintains this higher stress throughout the strain hardening regime. In this case, the imidazole ligand in Ni-2Im can form hydrogen bonds with the environment (via the non-metal-bound nitrogen atom),<sup>48</sup> while the methylimidazole and pyridine ligands in Ni-2MeIm and Ni-2Py cannot. Furthermore, the similarities between the Ni-2MeIm and Ni-2Py polymers are especially apparent in the cyclic responses, as their curves overlap to within experimental error. <span id="page-7-0"></span><span id="page-7-0"></span>Considering the group II polymers, we find that Ni-2Pipe has a greater strain hardening slope than Ni-2DMA. We attribute this greater mechanical strength of Ni-2Pipe to the increased dispersion interactions between the larger (and significantly more polarizable) piperidine ligand and the surrounding polymer environment.

# CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have demonstrated a facile procedure to incorporate metal-ligand cross-linking in UV-curable acrylic polymers. By attaching a series of coordinating neutral ligands to the metal center, we were able to finely tune the mechanical properties of the polymer. The simplicity of this approach has enabled a systematic investigation of the effects of changing the number and type of coordinating ligands on the cross-link without otherwise modifying the polymer. DFT calculations were used to first determine the number of ligands that would attach as a function of the total ligands available per metal center and then to investigate the mechanical and thermodynamic characteristics of the equilibrated metal coordination structures. These calculations predicted that the strength and stiffness of the cross-link strongly depend on the number of nitrogen-based ligands, but not on the type. Experimentally, these predictions were borne out in the bulk mechanical behavior at small strain. However, in the strain hardening regime, large differences were observed among the materials with different ligands, suggesting that ligand-environment interactions must also be considered in the rational design process of these versatile and highly tunable polymers.
