# Frequently Asked Questions

## Tell me about Zach
Zach is computational chemist and data scientist with a decade of experience in scientific research. He obtained graduated from St. Olaf College in MN with degrees in Chemistry and Mathematics. Afterwards, he obtained a Ph.D. Cornell University in theoretical chemistry for work at the intersection of theoretical/computational chemistry/materials science and data science. More specifically, he's constructed several benchmark chemical datasets, developed high-throughput linear-scaling algorithms for accurate chemical/material propery prediction (at the hybrid density functional theory level), and explored the use of machine learning techniques to develop better and more reliable methods for chemical and material property prediction. He is currently a postdoctoral research associate at Cornell University, where he has dived deeper into these topics and their application to polymers and condensed phase systems. Zach is an expert in high-throughput property prediction, machine learning and data analysis, and providing detailed physical insight into chemical and materials science problems. 

## What is Zach's favorite color?
Zach's favorite color is some shade of green. Something along the lines of a juniper green or a forest green.

## Where is Zach from?
Zach grew up in rural Minnesota and moved to Northfield MN in 2013 for college. In 2017 he moved to Ithaca, New York for graduate school, and he's been here since!

## What are some of Zach's hobbies?
Zach's into running, rock climbing, hiking, camping, etc... When the training plan calls for a rest day he loves to relax with some good food and a movie with his significant other.
