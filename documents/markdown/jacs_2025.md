# ABSTRACT

On the left side, there are two graphs representing molecular weight distributions. In the middle, there is a diagram of a machine learning model represented by interconnected nodes. On the right side, there are two diagrams representing polymer properties: rheological and mechanical.

Commodity plastics such as high density polyethylene (HDPE) have become integral to society. However, the potentially long-lasting ecological impacts of these plastics have spurred researchers to search for more sustainable solutions. One such solution is to develop a method for designing plastics with tunable and improved properties, thus decreasing the amount of material needed for various applications. In this work, we report a machine learning approach that maps the relationship between polymer molecular weight distributions (MWDs) and the physical properties (tensile and rheological) of HDPE. Using this approach, we design and generate HDPE materials with user-specified properties and valorize degraded postconsumer polyethylene waste. Implementation and development of this approach will facilitate the design of next-generation commodity materials and enable more efficient polymer recycling, thereby lowering the overall impact of HDPE on the environment.

# INTRODUCTION

High density polyethylene (HDPE) is ubiquitous in the current materials market due to its broad spectrum of physical and mechanical properties (e.g., chemical inertness, toughness, and flexibility).<sup>1</sup> HDPE is produced in ~100 million metric tons annually,<sup>2</sup> requiring over 2.8 EJ of energy per year<sup>3</sup>– almost 15 times the energy used to power New York City for a year. Predictably, the mass production of HDPE contributes to unprecedented levels of persistent plastic waste that accumulate in landfills and oceans.<sup>4,5</sup> Reduction of such waste by mechanical recycling is primarily limited by property degradation, with recycled HDPE often suffering from diminished strength and reduced processability due to chain scission and cross-linking.<sup>6,7</sup> Hence, it is essential to develop novel approaches to improve the sustainability of HDPE.

To address this challenge, we seek to develop an approach for designing HDPE materials with tunable processing parameters and improved mechanical properties. The ability to independently alter the processing parameters for a variety of industrial applications while making HDPE samples with improved tensile properties (e.g., stress at break and/or toughness) would enable the use of less material in many applications, thereby saving millions of tons of HDPE yearly.<sup>2,8</sup> Additionally, we also seek to address the issues plaguing mechanical recycling of HDPE. An approach that facilitates the design of HDPE samples comprised of high recycled content with physical properties and processability comparable to virgin materials—would significantly increase the sustainability of HDPE and help meet the upcoming 2030 EU mandate for recycled polymer content in consumer materials.<sup>9</sup>

Central to developing such an approach is a more complete understanding of the factors that govern the physical properties of HDPE. One of the most important factors is the molecular weight distribution (MWD), which is the distribution of chain lengths in a given polymer sample.<sup>10-18</sup> Traditionally, two statistical descriptors have been used to characterize MWDs, namely: number-average molar mass  $(M_n)$  and weight-average molar mass  $(M_w)$ . Increasing  $M_n$  and  $M_w$  is often associated with increased mechanical strength,<sup>11,18</sup> while increasing the dispersity (D), defined as the ratio  $M_{\rm w}/M_{\rm n}$ , has been shown to improve shear thinning behavior.<sup>15,16</sup> However, these statistical descriptors lack the ability to completely describe the entire chain length composition, and their use alone is insufficient to uniquely specify all MWDs.<sup>19,20</sup> As such, our understanding of how MWD composition affects polymer properties remains incomplete.

In this regard, there is a long-standing dogma that increasing mechanical strength is intrinsically coupled to decreased processability.<sup>21</sup> However, we recently reported that changing the skew of HDPE MWDs (without changing  $M_n$  or  $\mathcal{D}$ ) leads to dramatic differences in polymer viscosity with little change in mechanical properties.<sup>12</sup> In addition, He, Chen, and coworkers recently synthesized linear bimodal polyethylenes with simultaneously enhanced processability and mechanical properties.<sup>14</sup> While these studies show some ability to independently tune the rheological and tensile properties of polyethylene, the ability to precisely design MWDs with a targeted array of physical properties is still lacking and requires a more comprehensive understanding of the complex MWD– property relationship.

Image /page/1/Figure/3 description: The image shows a diagram of an experimental HDPE library and its predictive capabilities. The diagram is divided into two main sections: "Experimental HDPE Library" and "Predictive capabilities". In the "Experimental HDPE Library" section, there is a graph showing the molecular weight distribution of HDPE, ranging from 5.4 kDa to 2700 kDa. The HDPE is then blended to create 155 unique samples. These samples are characterized using GPC, rheology, and tensile properties. The data is then input into a PEPPr ML Model. In the "Predictive capabilities" section, there are two subsections: "Forward Mapping" and "Inverse Mapping". In the "Forward Mapping" subsection, the PEPPr model is used to predict properties such as low shear viscosity, high shear viscosity, stress at break, and toughness. In the "Inverse Mapping" subsection, the PEPPr ML Model is used to target properties for advanced applications.

(A) Generation of the experimental MWD– property data library from blended HDPE samples that was used to train the PEPPr (<u>PolyE</u>thylene <u>Property Predictor</u>) ML model. Predictive capabilities of PEPPr include: (B) forward mapping (MWD–physical properties) and (C) inverse mapping (physical properties–MWD).

Motivated by this challenge, we turned to machine learning (ML)- an effective tool used to identify, explore, and exploit patterns in complex data sets. While ML has been widely applied throughout the chemical sciences,<sup>22</sup> such data-driven applications in polymer science have been challenging due to the stochastic nature of polymers.<sup>23,24</sup> To date, most work in this area has focused on the prediction of polymer properties from monomers or single repeat units, without accounting for chain length distributions.<sup>25-27</sup> We reported a preliminary mapping of MWDs to polymer properties, where we predicted the domain spacing of poly(styrene-*block*-methyl methacrylate) thin films based on a set of statistical MWD descriptors that extend beyond  $M_{\rm p}$  and  $D.^{28}$  However, less work has employed the entire MWD for predicting polymer properties, due in part to the difficulty of generating standardized, accessible, and high-quality MWD-property data sets.<sup>29,30</sup> MWD-based polymer design also requires the ability to accurately and reliably predict the physical properties specified by a given MWD ("forward mapping") and to subsequently generate an MWD corresponding to a set of targeted physical properties ("inverse mapping"). Currently, the quite promising field of data-driven polymer design is in its infancy<sup>24,31,32</sup> and rarely experimentally validated.

In this work, we develop a ML model–PEPPr (<u>PolyE</u>thylene <u>Property Predictor</u>)–to further our understanding of the complex MWD–property relationships in HDPE with the aim of generating HDPE materials with targeted arrays of physical properties (Figure 1). Creation of PEPPr required the synthesis and characterization of an extensive HDPE library, consisting of 155 samples with a diverse range of MWDs and physical properties. After training PEPPr using this curated MWD–property data set, we validated its ability to predict both rheological (low and high shear viscosities) and mechanical (stress at break and toughness) properties from MWDs. We further showcased the polymer design capabilities of our approach by synthesizing several HDPE samples with targeted properties based on the MWDs predicted by PEPPr. To demonstrate a potential application of this approach, we used PEPPr to guide the valorization of recycled material by generating MWDs for HDPE samples with commercially competitive properties and high waste content.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

### Construction of the Experimental HDPE Library.
To generate a large enough data set to train PEPPr, we produced eight base polymers that were then used as building blocks for precisely accessing a diverse range of MWDs (Figure S1, Tables S1 and S2). These eight base polymers consisted of six narrow dispersity ( $D \le 1.4$ ) polymers with  $M_w$  values ranging from 42 kDa to 510 kDa that were synthesized using a single-site titanium-based catalyst system.<sup>34,35</sup> The two lowest molecular weight base polymers (with  $M_w = 16$  kDa, D = 2.2 and  $M_w = 39$  kDa, D = 2.0) were synthesized using zirconium-based systems<sup>36</sup> in order to encompass the range of chain lengths found in commercial HDPE. Although these nonliving systems produce broader MWDs ( $D \ge 2.0$ ), they were selected to reduce the amount of catalyst needed to synthesize adequate quantities of polymer.

Image /page/2/Figure/2 description: The image contains two scatter plots, labeled A and B. Plot A shows 'D' on the y-axis, ranging from 1 to 10 on a logarithmic scale, and 'M\_A (kDa)' on the x-axis, ranging from 0 to 600. Plot B shows 'Toughness (MJ m^-3)' on the y-axis, ranging from 0 to 600, and 'n\* at 40 Hz (kPa s)' on the x-axis, ranging from 0 to 10. Both plots include two data sets: 'Training' data, represented by light pink circles, and 'Test' data, represented by dark red squares. The data points are scattered across the plots, showing the relationship between the variables for both training and test datasets.

**Figure 2.** Visualization of the experimental HDPE library. (A) Wide range of D and  $M_w$  values present in the HDPE library (which includes both training and test data sets). (B) Toughness and high shear viscosity ( $\eta^*$ ) values in the HDPE library show little direct correlation, indicating that MWDs can be used to independently change the tensile and rheological properties of HDPE.

By solvent blending combinations of these eight base polymers, we generated 155 HDPE samples with unique MWDs (Figure S2, Tables S3 and S4). Solvent blending was chosen because of its modularity and universality between samples. The blended HDPE samples prepared using this method had  $M_w$  values ranging from 16 to 547 kDa and D values from 1.1 to 19 (Figure 2A). To ensure that our library encompassed commercial HDPE MWDs and guaranteed transferability outside our base polymers, we also included six commercial samples (Table S7 and Figure S5). These commercial HDPE samples were subject to the same solvent blending and melt pressing conditions to prevent processinginduced alignment effects.8 Frequency sweep rheological measurements were performed on all 161 HDPE samples to evaluate the effect of MWDs on melt viscosity. More specifically, we focused on the complex viscosity  $(\eta^*)$  at a low shear rate of 0.4 Hz and a high shear rate of 40 Hz. Samples displayed low shear viscosities between 0.04 and 425 kPa·s, and high shear viscosities between 0.03 and 8.0 kPa·s (Figures S3 and S6, Tables S5 and S8). Uniaxial tensile elongation tests were also performed to determine the stress at break (force required for failure) and toughness (energy required for fracture) of each sample. Stress at break values spanned from 7.7 to 68 MPa, and toughness values ranged from 0.28 to 695  $\rm MJ\,m^{-3}$  (Figures S4 and S7, Tables S6 and S9). We note that there is little direct correlation between the different measured properties in our HDPE library, demonstrating the potential to decouple and/or tune different polymer properties independently using MWDs. For example, we observed several samples with similar high shear viscosities but drastically different toughness values (Figure 2B). In fact, the samples with high shear viscosities between 4.0 and 4.5 kPa·s exhibit toughnesses ranging from 197 to 696 MJ·m<sup>-3</sup>. This observation bolsters previous reports<sup>12,14</sup> and provides further evidence that MWDs can be used to tune these properties. Given the lack of correlation (between measured properties and statistical MWD descriptors) and vast design space, designing advanced HDPE materials with a targeted array of rheological and mechanical properties poses a substantial challenge for intuition-driven trial-and-error methods, thus necessitating ML strategies like the one described herein.

### Construction and Training of the PEPPr ML Model.
The PEPPr ML model is comprised of an *ensemble* of 100 fully connected feed-forward neural networks (NNs, each of which contains 15 hidden layers with a width of 50 neurons per layer),<sup>37–39</sup> and implemented in PyTorch v2.0.1.<sup>40</sup> All hidden layers used the exponential linear unit (ELU) activation function,<sup>41</sup> and the final layer used a simple linear activation function. Input for PEPPr consisted of feature vectors generated by uniformly sampling each logarithmically transformed MWD at 15 points between molecular weights of 5.4 and 2700 kDa (which fully encompasses the base polymer MWDs). All feature vectors were normalized such that their inner product is one. PEPPr leverages multitarget learning with an output consisting of five logarithmically transformed properties (low shear viscosity, high shear viscosity, toughness, stress at break, and strain at break), standardized such that the mean and standard deviation of each property was zero and one, respectively. Standardization was performed to increase the convergence rate of the learning procedure and ensure that all properties were treated on the same footing.<sup>42</sup> The loss function (L) used to train PEPPr was chosen to be the mean absolute error between the (logarithmically transformed) predicted and experimental target properties averaged over all properties; this symmetric choice for L approximates the mean absolute percent error (APE) of the non-logarithmically transformed properties, but results in a less biased model.<sup>43,44</sup>

The test set was randomly constructed from 20 blended samples in the HDPE library (with low experimental uncertainties in their physical properties) and three commercial HDPE samples. The training set included the remaining 135 blended (and base) HDPE samples as well as three additional commercial HDPE samples. Since data augmentation has been shown to increase predictive performance on a number of deep learning tasks by increasing model robustness,<sup>45-47</sup> we augmented the blended samples in the training set with MWDs generated by "computationally blending" the base polymer MWDs in their corresponding experimental blending percentages. In practice, we found that this data augmentation process was critical for robust model performance when PEPPr was used for inverse mapping (physical properties  $\rightarrow$  MWD). Each NN was initialized using weights pulled from a uniform distribution between  $\pm 1/\sqrt{N_{in}}$  (where  $N_{\rm in}$  is the number of input features to the layer), which were then optimized by minimizing L using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 for 1000 epochs (Figures S8 and S9).<sup>48</sup> More details regarding the construction and training of the PEPPr model are provided in the Supporting Information and Tables S10 and S11.

### Accurate and Reliable Property Prediction Using PEPPr.
PEPPr predicts viscosities and mechanical properties with fairly high fidelity, as demonstrated by the relatively low median APEs obtained for the test set (Figure 3, Tables S12 and S13). Furthermore, these errors are comparable to those obtained on the training set, indicating that PEPPr is robust and does not suffer from overfitting. More specifically, PEPPr predicts low and high shear viscosities in the test set with median APEs of 21 and 13%, which is quite remarkable as these rheological properties span 2–3 orders of magnitude. A similar level of accuracy was achieved for the mechanical properties, with median APEs of 10 and 12% for the stress at break and toughness, respectively.

In Figure 4, we compare the experimental and PEPPrpredicted properties for three samples from the test set: two from our blended HDPE library and one commercial HDPE. As a first example, **Sample 1** has a bimodal MWD with experimental low and high shear viscosities of 8.2 and 3.1 kPas. PEPPr predicts these viscosities to be 9.0 and 3.5 kPa·s, both of which agree quite well with experiment. Predicted and experimental values for the mechanical properties of **Sample 1** exhibit similar fidelity: 33 MPa vs 29 MPa (stress at break) and 518 MJ·m<sup>−</sup><sup>3</sup> vs 557 MJ·m<sup>−</sup><sup>3</sup> (toughness).

<span id="page-3-0"></span><span id="page-3-0"></span>Image /page/3/Figure/1 description: The image contains four scatter plots comparing experimental and predicted values for different material properties. The plots are arranged in a 2x2 grid. The top-left plot shows "η\* at 0.4 Hz", with both axes ranging from 0.1 to 100 kPa·s. The top-right plot shows "η\* at 40 Hz", with both axes ranging from 0.1 to 10 kPa·s. The bottom-left plot shows "Stress at break", with both axes ranging from 0 to 60 MPa. The bottom-right plot shows "Toughness", with both axes ranging from 0 to 600 MJ·m³. Each plot includes a diagonal line representing perfect agreement between experimental and predicted values. Data points are scattered around the diagonal line, with different colors indicating training and test data. Each plot also displays the median absolute percentage error (APE) for both the test and training datasets. The median APE values are as follows: for "η\* at 0.4 Hz", Test: 21, Training: 14; for "η\* at 40 Hz", Test: 13, Training: 7; for "Stress at break", Test: 10, Training: 8; and for "Toughness", Test: 12, Training: 14.

Figure 3. Correlation plots show high fidelity between the experimental and PEPPr-predicted properties.

For the trimodal MWD of Sample 2, PEPPr predicted a low shear viscosity of 50 kPa·s compared to the experimental value of 32 kPa·s; at high shear, the predicted and experimental viscosities match exactly at 3.5 kPa·s. For the mechanical properties, PEPPr overestimates the stress at break and toughness for Sample 2, while the model prediction for the strain at break almost exactly matches the experimental value. We attribute some of the errors observed for Sample 2 to the lack of trimodal MWDs in the training set, and expect a sizable increase in accuracy with the inclusion of more complex multimodal MWDs when training future versions of PEPPr.

Even though the Sample 1 and Sample 2 MWDs are visibly different, these HDPE samples have similar high shear viscosities but markedly different toughness values. As such, these samples demonstrate the ability to hold certain variables constant (e.g., high shear viscosity) while independently varying others (e.g., toughness), which is necessary for designing HDPE materials with targeted properties. PEPPr is able to distinguish between these MWDs by predicting this trend, making this a promising approach for guiding the complex design process.

Image /page/3/Figure/9 description: The image contains three rows of plots, each row corresponding to a different sample: Sample 1, Sample 2, and commercial HDPE tubing. Each row consists of three plots: MWD (Molecular Weight Distribution), Complex Viscosities, and Tensile Properties. The MWD plots show the distribution of molecular weights on a logarithmic scale (log MW). The Complex Viscosities plots show the relationship between the complex viscosity (η\*, in kPa·s) and frequency (Hz) on a log-log scale. The Tensile Properties plots show the stress (MPa) as a function of strain (%). For Sample 1, the Complex Viscosities plot shows η\* at 0.4 Hz with predicted value 9.0 kPa·s and experimental value 8.2 kPa·s, and η\* at 40 Hz with predicted value 3.5 kPa·s and experimental value 3.1 kPa·s. The Tensile Properties plot for Sample 1 shows the stress at break with predicted value 33 MPa and experimental value 29 MPa, and toughness with predicted value 518 MJ·m⁻³ and experimental value 557 MJ·m⁻³. For Sample 2, the Complex Viscosities plot shows a value of 50 kPa·s predicted and 32 kPa·s experimental at low frequency, and 3.5 kPa·s predicted and 3.5 kPa·s experimental at high frequency. The Tensile Properties plot for Sample 2 shows a stress of 41 MPa predicted and 29 MPa experimental, and toughness of 234 MJ·m⁻³ predicted and 180 MJ·m⁻³ experimental. For commercial HDPE tubing, the Complex Viscosities plot shows a value of 19 kPa·s predicted and 13 kPa·s experimental at low frequency, and 1.3 kPa·s predicted and 1.1 kPa·s experimental at high frequency. The Tensile Properties plot shows a stress of 28 MPa predicted and 24 MPa experimental, and toughness of 168 MJ·m⁻³ predicted and 195 MJ·m⁻³ experimental.

In each MWD plot, *log* MW refers to the logarithmic transform of the molecular weight (in Da).

<span id="page-4-0"></span><span id="page-4-0"></span>Image /page/4/Figure/3 description: The image shows two sets of graphs, labeled A and B, illustrating inverse mapping in the context of polymer blends. Graph A includes three plots showing the relationship between frequency (Hz) on the x-axis and complex viscosity (η\*, in kPa·s) on the y-axis for three different polymer blends: Blend A, Blend B, and Blend C. Each plot includes a gray line representing the base PE and a data point indicating the predicted value. Blend A shows similar viscosity at 0.4 Hz and decreased viscosity at 40 Hz. Blend B shows increased viscosity at 0.4 Hz and similar viscosity at 40 Hz. Blend C shows increased viscosity at 0.4 Hz and decreased viscosity at 40 Hz. Graph B includes two bar charts. The first bar chart shows the complex viscosity (η\*, in kPa·s) at 0.4 Hz and 40 Hz for three different polymer blends: Blend D, Blend E, and Blend F. The second bar chart shows the stress at break (MPa) and toughness (MJ·m⁻³) for the same three polymer blends. Blend D shows similar viscosities and increased stress at break and toughness. Blend E shows decreased viscosities and similar stress at break. Blend F shows decreased viscosities and increased toughness.

**Figure 5.** Inverse mapping (physical properties  $\rightarrow$  MWD) using PEPPr. (A) PEPPr can predict HDPE blends with tunable low and high shear viscosities. (B) PEPPr can also predict HDPE blends with a variety of targeted rheological and mechanical properties. **Base PE** corresponds to Sample 5 in the Supporting Information. Detailed characterization values for these Blends are found in Tables S15 to S19 and Figures S10 to S12.

PEPPr also performs well when predicting the properties of commercially produced HDPE. Again, it was critical to follow the same blending procedure as the other samples to prevent incomparable measurements from processing-induced alignment effects.<sup>8</sup> Although the commercial sample was not synthesized using the base polymers and has a very broad MWD, PEPPr was still able to provide accurate property predictions. Experimental viscosities of this commercial polymer were measured to be 13 kPa·s at low shear and 1.1 kPa·s at high shear, compared to 19 and 1.3 kPa·s predicted by PEPPr. Finally, we measured the toughness and stress at break to be 195 MJ·m<sup>-3</sup> and 24 MPa, both of which were similar to the PEPPr—predicted values of 168 MJ·m<sup>-3</sup> and 28 MPa. This example illustrates that the predictive power of PEPPr is not limited to HDPE samples generated from the base polymers in the training set; rather, our ML model can provide predictions for any HDPE MWD.

### Designing MWDs with Targeted Properties Using PEPPr.
We next used PEPPr to predict MWDs given a set of desired properties (details regarding the inverse mapping procedure are provided in the Supporting Information and Table S14). To demonstrate the independent control that one can achieve over rheological and mechanical properties in HDPE, we looked to systematically change the physical properties of a reference polymer. For this purpose, we selected one of the base HDPE samples ( $M_n = 121$  kDa, D =1.2, Sample 5 in the Supporting Information) as the reference since its MWD is centered among the diverse samples in the HDPE library. This **base PE** exhibited a low shear viscosity of 20 kPa·s, a high shear viscosity of 5.4 kPa·s, stress at break of 31 MPa, and toughness of 280 MJ·m<sup>-3</sup>. Guided by PEPPr, we first demonstrate our ability to design MWDs that independently alter the low and high shear viscosities of **base PE** by: (1) fixing the low shear viscosity while decreasing the high shear viscosity, (2) increasing the low shear viscosity while fixing the high shear viscosity, and (3) simultaneously increasing the low shear viscosity and decreasing the high shear viscosity (Figure 5A).

Using PEPPr, we predicted an MWD that would have a similar low shear viscosity and a decreased high shear viscosity compared to base PE. This prediction was confirmed when we synthesized and characterized Blend A using the prescribed blending ratios provided by PEPPr, which had a comparable low shear viscosity (29 kPa·s) and a significantly decreased high shear viscosity  $(1.1 \text{ kPa} \cdot \text{s})$ . Industrially, this type of viscosity change in processes such as blow molding would allow similar structure retention but faster extrusion into the mold, thereby allowing for increased turnover.8 We then identified a second MWD, which was predicted by PEPPr to maintain the high shear viscosity of **base PE** while having an increased low shear viscosity. When synthesized, Blend B indeed displayed a significantly higher low shear viscosity of 192 kPa·s and a similar high shear viscosity of 4.5 kPa·s. In film blowing applications, this type of alteration could potentially allow for more stable air bubbles but similar die extrusion rates.<sup>8</sup> Finally, we used PEPPr to design an MWD with simultaneously targeted low and high shear viscosities. **Blend C** was measured to have an increased low shear viscosity compared to **base PE** (69 kPa·s) as well as a decreased high shear viscosity (2.3 kPa·s). Guided by PEPPr, these examples demonstrate the high level of control and tunability that one can obtain from MWDs, which has vast implications regarding the industrial processing of HDPE.

<span id="page-5-0"></span><span id="page-5-0"></span>Image /page/5/Figure/3 description: The image shows a comparison of the properties of commercially sourced pristine HDPE and post-consumer waste HDPE after degradation and valorization. The image is divided into two sections, A and B. Section A shows the properties of commercially sourced pristine HDPE, while section B shows the properties of post-consumer waste HDPE. Each section includes an image of the material, a graph of the molecular weight distribution (MWDs), a graph of the mechanical properties (stress vs. strain), and a graph of the complex viscosities. In section A, the MWDs graph shows three curves: Commercial HDPE, 30 min extrusion, and Blend G. The mechanical properties graph shows the stress-strain curves for the same three materials, with the Commercial HDPE showing the highest stress at a given strain. The complex viscosities graph shows the viscosity as a function of frequency for the three materials. In section B, the MWDs graph shows three curves: Post Consumer HDPE, 30 min extrusion, and Blend H. The mechanical properties graph shows the stress-strain curves for the same three materials, with the Blend H showing the highest stress at a given strain. The complex viscosities graph shows the viscosity as a function of frequency for the three materials.

**Figure 6.** Degradation and subsequent valorization of commercial HDPE using PEPPr. (A) PEPPr is used to restore the toughness of a mechanically degraded commercial HDPE sample. (B) PEPPr is used to restore the stress at break and viscosities of degraded postconsumer HDPE waste. Detailed characterization values for **Blend G** and **Blend H** are found in Tables S20–S23 and Figures S13–S15. In each MWD plot, *log* MW refers to the logarithmic transform of the molecular weight (in Da).

We were also interested in tuning both the rheological and mechanical properties of HDPE. In doing so, we were able to identify and synthesize HDPE samples predicted by PEPPr that: (1) retained processing viscosities while increasing stress at break and toughness, (2) decreased viscosities while maintaining material stress at break, and (3) both decreased viscosities and increased mechanical toughness relative to base PE (Figure 5B). Using PEPPr, we first identified Blend D, a sample with similar low (22 kPa·s) and high (5.4 kPa·s) shear viscosities, but markedly increased stress at break (48 MPa) and toughness (528 MJ·m<sup>-3</sup>) compared to base PE. This type of advance would allow industrial applications to make more durable plastics without changing their processing methods. We also used PEPPr to discover Blend E, a sample with decreased viscosities (14 and 2.7 kPa·s) and a similar stress at break (37 MPa vs 31 MPa) as base PE. In contrast to Blend D, samples with these characteristics would allow for manufacturing products of similar physical properties at a lower cost, as lower viscosities could allow for faster product turnover.

Finally, a sample combining both attributes, decreased viscosities and increased mechanical properties, was identified by PEPPr. **Blend F** decreases the viscosities at low (4.6 kPa·s) and high (1.8 kPa·s) shear, and also doubles the toughness (582 MJ·m<sup>-3</sup> vs 280 MJ·m<sup>-3</sup>) of **base PE**. We have thus demonstrated the ability of our ML-guided and experimentally validated approach to finding high-performance plastics. A more durable plastic that requires similar if not easier processing could have massive effects on production and waste. As ~100 million metric tons of HDPE is made per year,<sup>2</sup> just a 1% decrease in mass per application due to a stronger material would reduce production, and therefore waste, by ~1 million metric tons per year.

### Valorizing Degraded Post-Consumer HDPE.
Having explored the inverse mapping capabilities of PEPPr on pristine polymers, we investigated how PEPPr might also be used to valorize mechanically recycled HDPE. Mechanical recycling of HDPE often leads to chain scission, cross-linking, and degraded properties.<sup>6,7</sup> We envisioned that our approach would be able to combat this issue by identifying MWDs that include a predefined amount of the degraded material yet still retain the physical properties of the pristine HDPE sample. In doing so, PEPPr would provide the exact additive polymers needed to valorize degraded plastic.

We first tested this idea on a commercially sourced HDPE sample. To simulate multiple accelerated recycling cycles, the polymer was fed through a screw extruder for 30 min. The polymer was then subject to the same solvent blending and <span id="page-6-0"></span><span id="page-6-0"></span>melt pressing procedure described above. Characterization of the resulting sample revealed a 40% decrease in toughness (501 to 288  $MJ \cdot m^{-3}$ ), most likely due to the scission of longer tie-chains required to distribute force.<sup>6,7</sup> Viscosities were not significantly altered.

The MWD of the degraded material was input into the PEPPr model as an additional base polymer. Without retraining, we used PEPPr to identify **Blend G**, which contained 50% of the degraded sample, 40% of the  $M_n = 103 \text{ kDa}$ , D = 1.2 base polymer, and 10% of the  $M_n = 40 \text{ kDa}$ , D = 1.1 base polymer in our HDPE library. Notably, **Blend G** exhibited a restored (and slightly increased) toughness (556 MJ·m<sup>-3</sup>) and retained viscosities similar to those of the pristine polymer (Figure 6A).

With this result in hand, we applied our method to postconsumer HDPE waste. Upon 30 min screw extrusion of HDPE cushioning packaging, we observed a dramatic decrease of the stress at break (from 30 to 17 MPa). Viscosity values at both low and high shear rates also decreased substantially, from 29 to 7.7 kPa·s at 0.4 Hz and 1.5 to 0.6 kPa·s at 40 Hz. Using PEPPr, we searched for a blend that would restore both the stress at break and the viscosities to their pristine values. We identified Blend H as a candidate, composed of 50% of the degraded plastic, 10% of the  $M_{\rm p}$  = 103 kDa, D = 1.2 base polymer, 10% of the  $M_n$  = 294 kDa, D = 1.2 base polymer, 20% of the  $M_{\rm n}$  = 429 kDa, D = 1.2 base polymer, and 10% of the  $M_{\rm n}$ = 18 kDa, D = 2.2 base polymer. Formulating this blend yielded a polymer with a stress at break of 31 MPa, a low shear viscosity of 31 kPa·s, and a high shear viscosity of 1.8 kPa·s, all of which were similar to the original packaging values (Figure **6**B).

We note that both **Blend G** and **Blend H** easily surpass the 35% recycled content required in the EU by 2030.<sup>9</sup> Furthermore, we envision that this method can be universally applied at any recycling facility, with the possibility of altering the properties of a degraded sample to use in an entirely different application with different mechanical and processing requirements.

# CONCLUSIONS

We have trained a ML model (PEPPr) using an extensive library of synthesized and characterized HDPE samples with a diverse range of MWDs and physical properties. PEPPr can be used to predict polymer properties from a given MWD as well as a polymer MWD given user-specified properties. These capabilities are critical to generating HDPE materials with finely tuned processing and mechanical properties, with the potential to dramatically increase the sustainability of this commodity plastic. We further demonstrated the utility of PEPPr by valorizing mechanically degraded postconsumer waste.

Looking to the future, we plan to expand the scope of predictable properties; for instance, crack resistance and melt strength could easily be incorporated through more data collection. Furthermore, we emphasize that the mechanical properties of polymers are highly dependent on processing methods. We expect to successfully encompass the effects of different processing methods into our ML model by including processing methods as another input feature. We also plan to expand the ML model to other polymer classes such as isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) by employing a similar method of data collection and model generation as described herein.

The ML-guided and experimentally validated approach in this work provides a straightforward and effective pathway to application-specific polymer design, opening the door to understanding, improving, and reusing commercial polymers.
